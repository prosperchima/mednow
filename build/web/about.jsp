                         <p>MedNow disease diagnosis is a system that automates most of the traditional
                        activities when dealing with patients. This system aims to ease the stress
                        encountered when patients are sick. It also helps to give immediate prescription
                        to patients who can?t afford to pay for hospital bills.
                        This project commenced with a condense investigation into the existing system
                        to find problems at hand and then to propose a solution to the problem. There
                        was also literature review to acquire more knowledge from other people work,
                        which helped to enhance the development of the system.
                        The project main objective which was achieved using a high level language and
                        a relational database management system (JAVA and MYSQL) to create a web
                        based application that provide the patients, where they can be diagnosed with all
                        qualification provided.</p>
                        <p>The system could be used majorly in the following areas such as<p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>University Medicals</li>
                            <li> Hospitals </li>
                            <li>Pharmacies</li>
                       
                        </ol>
                        <p>The system was also designed to ease the stress involved in disease diagnosis. Most
                        importantly is that the system is fast and it helps to reduce error as regards to
                        
                        every patient?s information. The system will also ease the work of the medical
                        administration.</p>
                        <p>This web based system is designed for people who cannot afford to visit
                        hospitals. For the past few years, the number of online disease diagnosis system
                        has increased rapidly. This particular project deals with the problem of disease
                        diagnosis and drug prescription for Malaria and Typhoid.</p>

                        <p>This system is recommended for all hospitals and pharmaceutical outlets. It will
                        handle all the necessary process involved in a patients? diagnosis and drug
                        prescription. Also, research on this project should continue to be expanded so as
                        to include other area of interest.</p>
